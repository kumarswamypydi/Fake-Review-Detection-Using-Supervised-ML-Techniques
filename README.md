# Fake-Review-Detection-Using-Supervised-ML-Techniques
**Abstract**


The proliferation of online reviews has become a pivotal factor influencing consumer 
decisions. However, the prevalence of fake reviews poses a significant challenge to the authenticity of 
these platforms. We aim to address this issue through the implementation of a Fake review detection 
using Supervised Machine Learning Techniques. The collections of dataset encompass both genuine and 
deceptive reviews. Various features, including language patterns, and review metadata, are extracted to 
form a comprehensive set of input variables. A Supervised Learning algorithm, such as logistic 
regression, support vector machines, or neural networks, is employed to train the model using the 
labelled dataset. The trained model undergoes rigorous evaluation to gauge its effectiveness in 
discerning between authentic and fake reviews. Fine-tuning and optimization processes are carried out 
based on the evaluation results to enhance the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities. Upon 
successful development and validation, the ultimate goal is to provide a practical tool for online 
platforms and businesses to automatically identify and mitigate the impact of fake reviews. This 
research contributes to the field of online reputation management and consumer trust by leveraging 
advanced machine learning techniques to foster a more reliable online review ecosystem.
